## Install

```sh
# Install it locally for your npm project
npm install -D pivotal-flow

# You can also install it globally
npm install -g pivotal-flow
```

`pivotal-flow` works best with [`husky` üê∂][husky] & [`git-tracker`][git-tracker].

## Usage

`pivotal-flow` has two commands to automate your workflow:

1. `pivotal-flow`:
  Create a new story or work on an existing story via the command line.
2. `pivotal-flow-check`:
  Check all newly created branches have the pivotal story ID in the branch name.

> you can also use the `pf` alias for `pivotal-flow`

### Starting a new story

Run `pivotal-flow` (alias: `pf`) as a local/global command to start creating stories from the command line:

### Work on an existing story

![my stories](https://assets1.cleartax-cdn.com/cleargst-frontend/misc/1567672934_mystories.gif)

### Fuzzy search

### Adding a post-checkout hook

You can add the `pivotal-flow-check` as a post-checkout hook via [`husky` üê∂][husky].
Just add it to your `package.json` file, for example:

```diff
   },
   "husky": {
     "hooks": {
        // ...
+      "post-checkout": "pivotal-flow-check"
     }
   }
 }
```

Now, while checking out a new branch, you can ensure that the [Pivotal][pivotal] story id is added to your branch name.

Using this alongside [`git-tracker`][git-tracker] and the [`Pivotal GitHub Integration`][pivotal-github] ensures your updates (commits, pushes, merges etc) on GitHub are posted directly and automatically to your Pivotal stories.

### Working on multiple projects

pivotal-flow supports working on multiple projects. You can do this by adding individual `PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID` exports for each of your projects in your `.zshrc`, `.bashrc` or any other shell config, example:

```
export PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID={project_id}
export PIVOTAL_PROJECT_ID={project_id}
```

### Other

Follow instructions for [`git-tracker`][git-tracker] and the [`Pivotal GitHub Integration`][pivotal-github] to set-up the entire flow for your repository.
