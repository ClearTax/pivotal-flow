## Install

```sh
# Install it locally for your npm project
npm install -D pivotal-flow

# You can also install it globally
npm install -g pivotal-flow
```

`pivotal-flow` is built to work with [`husky` üê∂][husky] along with the [Pivotal GitHub integration][pivotal-github].

## Set up

If installed locally for your npm project, add the hooks and commands from `pivotal-flow` to your `package.json` file, for example:

```diff
   },
   "scripts": {
     // ...
+     "start:story": "pivotal-flow start"
   },
   "husky": {
     "hooks": {
+      "post-checkout": "pivotal-flow hook post-checkout",
+      "prepare-commit-msg": "pivotal-flow hook prepare-commit-msg",
+      "commit-msg": "pivotal-flow hook commit-msg",
     }
   }
 }
```

To be able to use the `pivotal-flow` [commands](#commands), run `pivotal-flow init` it will create a `.pivotal-flow` config in your home directory.
With below structure. To be able work on  more projects add the project details in the config file.

```js

    {
        pivotalToken: '23bca3#######################',
        projects: [
            { 
              projectId: 12345, 
              projectName: "coolProject"
            }
        ]
    }    

```

## Usage

`pivotal-flow` has few commands to automate your workflow.

Run `pivotal-flow --help` to see usage & documentation.

> you can also use the `pf` alias for `pivotal-flow`.

## Commands

### init

```sh
# provides instructions on how to get set-up to use other pivotal-flow commands
$ pivotal-flow init
```

### start

Create a new story or work on an existing story via the command line.

```sh
 # start working on a story guided by a questionnaire
 $ pivotal-flow start

 # create a new story & then start working on it
 $ pivotal-flow start --new
```

## Hooks

### `post-checkout`

Check that all _newly created branches_ have a [Pivotal][pivotal] Story ID in the branch name.

**Why do we need the ID in the branch?**
This allows the GitHub integration to send updates to pivotal to [show branch & PR information in a story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/github_integration/#using-the-github-integration-branches).

### `prepare-commit-msg`

Picks up story ID from a branch name & appends it to each commit message.

Again, this allows the GitHub integration to send updates to pivotal of [commit information in a story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/github_integration/#using-the-github-integration-commits).

### `commit-msg`

Checks if _each_ new commit message contains the Story ID as well.

In case you're not using the automatic addition hook (`prepare-commit-msg`) or don't want to enforce story id being present in branch name, this hook makes sure the Story ID is present in the commit message (added by other means by the user).

## Starting a new story

Run `pivotal-flow` (alias: `pf`) as a local/global command to start creating stories from the command line:

## Work on an existing story

![my stories](https://assets1.cleartax-cdn.com/cleargst-frontend/misc/1567672934_mystories.gif)

### Fuzzy search

### Other

Using `pivotal-flow` hooks alongside [`Pivotal GitHub Integration`][pivotal-github] ensures your updates (commits, pushes, merges etc) on GitHub are posted directly and automatically to your Pivotal stories.

Follow instructions for and the [`Pivotal GitHub Integration`][pivotal-github] to set-up the entire flow for your repository.

## Credits

The concept of adding Story IDs (picked from the branch-name) to all commits are from the awesome [`git-tracker`][git-tracker] project by [@stevenharman](https://github.com/stevenharman) - ported to husky/node implementation in `pivotal-flow`'s `prepare-commit-msg` hook.
