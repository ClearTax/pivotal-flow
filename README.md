## Install

```sh
# install pivotal-flow globally
# you can check if it was installed correctly by running `pivotal-flow --version`
npm install -g pivotal-flow

# initialize pivotal-flow
pivotal-flow init
```

`pivotal-flow` is built to work with [`husky` üê∂][husky] along with the [Pivotal GitHub integration][pivotal-github].

## Commands

### init

A guided questionnaire to set-up `pivotal-flow` with the basic [configuration](#configuration):

```sh
$ pivotal-flow init
# generate a basic configuration file in your home directory.
```

### start

Create a new story or work on an existing story (from the [stories](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/working_with_stories/) in your [PivotalTracker project(s)](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/creating_a_project/)):

```sh
$ pivotal-flow start
# start working on a story guided by a questionnaire
```

## git-hooks via husky

`pivotal-flow` also provides a few [git-hooks] to automate a few tasks when working with `PivotalTracker` as your project management tool. You can add the provided hooks using [husky].

### Set-up

In order to use the hooks from `pivotal-flow`, add it as a dependency to your npm project:

```sh
$ npm install --save-dev pivotal-flow
# install it as a dev-dependency
```

Then add the hooks and/or commands to your `package.json`:

```diff
   },
   "scripts": {
     // ...
+     "start:story": "pivotal-flow start"
   },
   "husky": {
     "hooks": {
+      "post-checkout": "pivotal-flow hook check-story-id-in-branch",
+      "prepare-commit-msg": "pivotal-flow hook add-story-id-to-commit",
+      "commit-msg": "pivotal-flow hook check-story-id-in-commit",
     }
   }
 }
```

## Configuration

Once the `init` command is run, it creates a config file in your home directory. This is meant to be a per-user configuration.

You can modify/add the configuration file in multiple levels which are supported via [cosmiconfig].

Currently, a configuration file looks like the following:

```json
{
  "projects": [
    {
      "name": "Alpha",
      "id": 1234567
    },
    {
      "name": "Bravo",
      "id": 7654321
    }
  ],
  "pivotalApiToken": "abcde*****************************"
}
```

**NOTE**: Since the `pivotalApiToken` is meant to be private, we discourage keeping the `pivotal-flow` configuration file under source control.

### Options

|Option|Type|Description|
|---|---|---|
|`pivotalApiToken`|`string`|[API Token from PivotalTracker](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/api_token/).|
|`projects`|`project[]`|A list of PivotalTracker projects which will be part of your workflow for creating / working on stories.|
|`projects[i].name`|`string`|The name of the project (or an alias) to be used when picking among projects in the different commands.|
|`projects[i].id`|`string|number`|Each `PivotalTracker` project has an `id` which you can find by referring to your project's URL. For example, if your project's URL is `https://www.pivotaltracker.com/n/projects/1234567` then the project `id` would be `1234567`. This is required to query the stories from the project|

## Usage

`pivotal-flow` has few commands to automate your workflow.

Run `pivotal-flow --help` to see usage & documentation.

> you can also use the `pf` alias for `pivotal-flow`.

## Hooks

### `post-checkout`

Check that all _newly created branches_ have a [Pivotal][pivotal] Story ID in the branch name.

**Why do we need the ID in the branch?**
This allows the GitHub integration to send updates to pivotal to [show branch & PR information in a story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/github_integration/#using-the-github-integration-branches).

### `prepare-commit-msg`

Picks up story ID from a branch name & appends it to each commit message.

Again, this allows the GitHub integration to send updates to pivotal of [commit information in a story](https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/articles/github_integration/#using-the-github-integration-commits).

<img src="https://www.pivotaltracker.com/help/kb_assets/github_integration_11@2x.png" width="300" />

### `commit-msg`

Checks if _each_ new commit message contains the Story ID as well.

In case you're not using the automatic addition hook (`prepare-commit-msg`) or don't want to enforce story id being present in branch name, this hook makes sure the Story ID is present in the commit message (added by other means by the user).

## Starting a new story

Run `pivotal-flow` (alias: `pf`) as a local/global command to start creating stories from the command line:

## Work on an existing story

![my stories](https://assets1.cleartax-cdn.com/cleargst-frontend/misc/1567672934_mystories.gif)

### Fuzzy search

### Other

Using `pivotal-flow` hooks alongside [`Pivotal GitHub Integration`][pivotal-github] ensures your updates (commits, pushes, merges etc) on GitHub are posted directly and automatically to your Pivotal stories.

Follow instructions for and the [`Pivotal GitHub Integration`][pivotal-github] to set-up the entire flow for your repository.

## Credits

The concept of adding Story IDs (picked from the branch-name) to all commits are from the awesome [`git-tracker`][git-tracker] project by [@stevenharman](https://github.com/stevenharman) - ported to husky/node implementation in `pivotal-flow`'s `prepare-commit-msg` hook.
